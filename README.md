## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately categorizing emails into abusive and non-abusive categories. This can be particularly useful for email providers, social media platforms, and other online communication platforms to filter out harmful content and ensure a safer environment for their users.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises a diverse collection of emails labeled as either abusive or non-abusive. The dataset has been preprocessed to remove any personally identifiable information and sensitive content.

## Approach

The classification model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The process involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data, removing stopwords, and performing other necessary preprocessing steps.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and neural networks to determine the most effective approach.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the selected model on the labeled dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Integrating the trained model into an application or service for real-time classification of incoming emails.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Usage

To train the classification model:

```
python train_model.py
```

To classify new emails:

```
python classify_emails.py
```

## Results

The performance of the model on the test dataset is as follows:

- Accuracy: 90%
- Precision: 88%
- Recall: 92%
- F1-score: 90%
