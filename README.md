## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that accurately categorizes emails into abusive and non-abusive categories. This can be particularly useful for email providers, social media platforms, and other online communication platforms to filter out harmful content and ensure a safer environment for their users.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises a diverse collection of emails labeled as abusive or non-abusive. The dataset has been preprocessed to remove personally identifiable information and sensitive content.

## Approach

The classification model is built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The process involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data, removing stopwords, and performing other necessary preprocessing steps.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting relevant features from the text data, such as TF-IDF vectors or word embeddings.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and neural networks to determine the most effective approach.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the selected model on the labeled dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Deployment**: Integrating the trained model into an application or service for real-time classification of incoming emails.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Results

The performance of the model on the test dataset is as follows:

- Passive Aggressive Classifier--------->99.56%
- Naive Bayes--------------------------->97.10%
- TFIDF---------------------------------->99.61%
- TFIDF: Bigrams------------------------>99.71%
- TFIDF: Trigrams------------------------>99.71%
